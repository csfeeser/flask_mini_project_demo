# Demo Flask Mini-Project

**alta3research-flask01.py**- This contains the Flask server. It has included every possible option described in the [project readme](https://live.alta3.com/content/tlg-sde-python/labs/content/pyb/PROJECT_flask_api.html)

**alta3research-requests02.py**- This fulfills the second requirement by sending a GET request to the server. It randomly chooses one of the quotes and prints it out nicely :)
